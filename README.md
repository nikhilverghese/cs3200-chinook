CS3200 Assignment 3: SQLite DDL and DML

In this assignment you will practice the SQL skills developed in the course. For this, we will be using the sample SQLITE database found on https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/ . Links to an external site.Download the database, and then, complete the following tasks:

 

Query 1: Create a new Table Music Video, that is a class of type Track (generalization) but adds the attribute Video director. A music video is a track. There cannot be a video without a track, and each track can have either no video or just one. 
Query 2: Write the queries that insert at least 10 videos, respecting the problem rules.
Query 3:  Insert another video for the track "Voodoo", assuming that you don't know the TrackId, so your insert query should specify the TrackId directly.
Tip: For a different database with People and Quotes, here is how to insert a Quote from the name of the Person

-- Inserts John in the Person table

INSERT INTO Persons(name) VALUES("John");

-- Inserts a new Quote for John

INSERT INTO Quote(person_id, quote)
    SELECT person_id, "It Worked 🎉"
    FROM Person
    WHERE name == "John";

Query 4:  Write a query that lists all the customers that listen to longer-than-average tracks, excluding the tracks that are longer than 15 minutes. 
Query 5:  Write a query that lists all the tracks that are not in one of the top 5 genres with longer duration in the database. 
Query 6:  Define an insightful query on your own that involves at least three tables
